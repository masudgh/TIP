        Solve the N-queen problem using recursion. (There may be other ways of solving this problem,
        but for the purpose of this exercise, please use recursion only).
        Problem statement: Place N queens on an NxN chessboard, such that no two queens are in
        line of attack of each other. In chess (and in real life too), a queen can move as far as she
        pleases, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
        Input: N
        Output: All possible arrangements of N queens on the board. Each arrangement can be
        represented by a matrix. Print the entire matrix, one per valid arrangement. For example, for
        N = 4, there are two possible arrangements, that can be printed as:
        +-+-+-+-+
        | | |*| |
        +-+-+-+-+
        |*| | | |
        +-+-+-+-+
        | | | |*|
        +-+-+-+-+
        | |*| | |
        +-+-+-+-+
        +-+-+-+-+
        | |*| | |
        +-+-+-+-+
        | | | |*|
        +-+-+-+-+
        |*| | | |
        +-+-+-+-+
        | | |*| |
        +-+-+-+-+
        Tests: In your main() method, call your function for every N from 1 through 10, and print the
        output.
